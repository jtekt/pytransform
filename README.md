# PyTransform

Python Package to control [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix) of 3D objects.
The transform are widely used in Game Engines and Robot Simulators.
However, these transforms depend on their platform strongly.
This project aims to develop the independent transform module.

`Transform` class in this project has Unity like methods.
